Different electoral system can be cathegorized by their commonalities

The most basic distinction can be made between single winner and multiple seat districts.

# Single winner
In these systems proportionality is sacrificed in order to give each district a clear winner. Different systems can
 be be devised to designate this individual winner:
 + Majority wins (First past the post)
 + Multiple rounds (beyond the scope of this analysis)
 + Instant runoff, in these systems the vote being cast provides information on how the voter would've voted in
  different circumstances.
    + Alternative Voting
    + Instant runoff
    + Condorcet methods
Save for FPTP whose implementation is trivial these methods require iterating over various configurations, each time
 transfering the votes between candidates.

# Multiple seat districts
